general_text: "<p>Development has dealt us a purified city of crisp, clipped lines
  and careful order. Sober streetscapes have forgotten their true nature and by turn
  we have forgotten ours. A wilder city lies slumbering and it is time we woke it
  up.<br><br>We invite you to step off the pre-prescribed pathways and transgress.
  Breathe more deeply and feel more keenly, behave more wildly and care more fully.
  Dig a little deeper into what makes a city and explore a more-than-human landscape.
  <br><br>We make things enchanting by the kind of attention we give to them. As we
  nurture the city, a more dramatic, romantic and abundant city awaits us. </p>"
