  an innovative and responsibly designed location for the city to discover; to grow
  within; and to belong to. Underpinned by a people led approach to creating place,
  NOMA is a home for pioneering projects which keep creativity and community at their
  heart.</p><p>With four acres of public space committed across the neighbourhood,
  NOMA provides Plant NOMA with plentiful room in which a wilder city can emerge –
  not just in hidden corners and nooks &amp; crannies, but as a central point of the
  masterplan.</p>"
